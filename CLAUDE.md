## Project Overview

A web application for two domains at Yi Hui Tech (internal tooling):

1. **Projects domain** — daily worker assignment to projects, timesheets, and rolling labour cost tracking
2. **Trips domain** — truck trip dispatch, bin tracking, and WhatsApp message generation for drivers

**Live URL:** Deployed on Vercel (staging)
**Repo:** https://github.com/yihui-tech/worker-assignment
**Companion app:** `trips-records` (driver-facing, runs on localhost:3001 in dev) shares the same Supabase project

## Database Schema

> Schema reflects actual Supabase table structure. All columns nullable unless marked NOT NULL / PK.

### workers
```sql
employee_id  text PRIMARY KEY        -- Format: YH0001 (from Times Software HR)
nric         text UNIQUE             -- Singapore NRIC
name         text NOT NULL
monthly_rate numeric NOT NULL        -- Gross monthly salary in SGD
role         text
active       boolean
created_at   timestamptz
```

### projects
```sql
id           uuid PRIMARY KEY

location     text
start_date   date
end_date     date
status       text                    -- active | completed | on-hold
created_at   timestamptz
```

### assignments
```sql
id             uuid PRIMARY KEY
worker_id      text REFERENCES workers(employee_id)
project_id     uuid REFERENCES projects(id)
assigned_date  date NOT NULL
shift          text                  -- full_day | morning | afternoon

worker_id      text REFERENCES workers(employee_id)
project_id     uuid REFERENCES projects(id)
date           date NOT NULL

```

### vehicles
```sql
plate_number      text PRIMARY KEY   -- e.g. SBX1234A
default_driver_id text               -- references drivers(employee_id)
vehicle_type      text

created_at        timestamptz
```

### drivers
```sql
employee_id    text PRIMARY KEY      -- matches workers.employee_id format
nric           text NOT NULL

monthly_salary numeric
access_token   uuid                  -- used by trips-records app for driver auth
created_at     timestamptz
```
> `access_token` is the simple auth mechanism for the trips-records driver app (pre-full Auth implementation).

### customers
```sql
customer_id    integer PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY
name           text NOT NULL
contact_person text
contact_number text
address        text                  -- used as pickup location in trips
created_at     timestamptz
```

### locations
```sql
id         integer PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY
name       text NOT NULL
address    text                      -- used as dropoff location in trips
created_at timestamptz
```

### trips
```sql
id              uuid PRIMARY KEY
vehicle_number  text REFERENCES vehicles(plate_number)
driver_id       text REFERENCES drivers(employee_id)
customer_id     integer REFERENCES customers(customer_id)  -- pickup source
dropoff_id      integer REFERENCES locations(id)           -- dropoff destination
requester       text
remarks         text
status          text                 -- open | completed | cancelled
created_at      timestamptz
```

### trip_bins
```sql
id         uuid PRIMARY KEY
trip_id    uuid REFERENCES trips(id)
bin_id     uuid REFERENCES bins(id)
action     text NOT NULL            -- dropoff | pickup
created_at timestamptz
```
- `dropoff` = bin delivered TO the customer site (leaves yard, arrives at customer)
- `pickup` = bin collected FROM the customer site (leaves customer, returns to yard)

### bins
```sql
id             uuid PRIMARY KEY
serial_number  text UNIQUE NOT NULL  -- e.g. H1232
customer_id    integer REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
location_id    integer REFERENCES locations(id)
created_at     timestamptz
```
Current location logic:
- `customer_id` set → bin is at that customer site
- `location_id` set → bin is at that yard/location
- both null → location unknown

### weigh_bridge
```sql
vehicle_number    text REFERENCES vehicles(plate_number)
driver_id         text REFERENCES drivers(employee_id)
material_type_ids integer[]          -- array of material_types.id
material_custom   text
gross_weight      numeric
tare_weight       numeric
net_weight        numeric            -- manually entered or computed by driver app
customer_id       integer REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
pickup_id         integer            -- legacy field
dropoff_id        integer REFERENCES locations(id)
trip_id           uuid REFERENCES trips(id)  -- links load to a trip (null for legacy entries)
remarks           text
created_at        timestamptz
```
> `net_weight` is stored (not generated) — driver app calculates and inserts it.
> Legacy standalone entries may have null `trip_id`.

### material_types
```sql
id    integer PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY
name  text NOT NULL
```

## Row Level Security

RLS is enabled on all tables. Current staging policies allow public SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
When Auth is implemented, policies must be updated to scope by authenticated user role.

**Known issue pattern:** missing UPDATE or INSERT policies cause silent failures (data appears saved but Supabase returns no error in some client versions). Always verify all four policies exist on new tables.

---

## Supabase Client

```typescript
// app/lib/supabase.ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!;
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!;

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
```

> Note: Currently using `@supabase/supabase-js` directly. When Auth is added, migrate to `@supabase/ssr` with `createBrowserClient` for client components and `createServerClient` for server components.

**FK join syntax:** `supabase.from('trips').select('*, customers(name, address)')` — results require `as unknown as MyType[]` cast due to Supabase TypeScript limitations.

**Integer PKs on customers/locations:** use `String(id)` in select values, `parseInt(value, 10)` in insert/update payloads.

## Pages Summary

### / (Home Dashboard)
- Two-panel layout: Project Costs (2/3 width) + Bin Locations (1/3 width)
- Cost panel: current month, active projects only, sorted by cost descending. Links to `/cost`
- Bins panel: grouped by At Customer Site / At Yard / Unknown Location. Links to `/bins`

### /projects
- Create new projects with name, location, start date, end date, status
- Edit existing projects via modal (pencil icon button)
- Mandays column shows total assignment mandays per project
- Status options: active | completed | on-hold

### /assignments
- Pick a date → see all active workers
- Assign each worker to a project for that day
- Toggle **Split** to assign a worker to two different projects (morning/afternoon)
- Save handles upsert — re-opening the same date reloads existing assignments

### /timesheets
- Enter regular hours and OT hours per worker per project per date
- Source tracked as `manual` (CSV import from Times Software not yet built)

### /cost
- Toggle between This Month and All Time views
- Filter by project status (all | active | completed | on-hold)
- Shows rolling labour cost per project calculated from timesheets
- Summary card shows total cost across all projects

### /trips
- Create and manage truck dispatch trips
- Fields: vehicle, driver, customer (with inline "Create new customer" flow), dropoff location, requester, remarks
- Bin movements: optionally add bins to a trip with action = `dropoff` or `pickup`
  - Auto-suggests action based on bin's current location (yard → dropoff, customer → pickup)
- Trip list shows: vehicle, customer, dropoff, net weight breakdown per load, requester, status badge, date
- Actions per trip:
  - **Complete** (open trips only) — sets status to `completed`, auto-updates bin locations
  - **Cancel** (open trips only) — sets status to `cancelled`
  - **Clipboard icon** — opens WhatsApp message preview modal with Copy Message button
  - **Edit icon** — opens edit modal
  - **Delete icon** — deletes trip

### /bins
- Register and manage physical bin inventory
- CRUD via modal (create + edit)
- Location filter tabs: All / At Customer / At Yard / Unknown
- Current location shown as colour-coded badge (blue = customer, green = yard, gray = unknown)
- Location is auto-updated when a trip containing the bin is marked complete

### /customers
- Manage customer records: company name, contact person, contact number, address (pickup location)
- Full CRUD with edit and delete icon buttons

---

## WhatsApp Message Format

Generated by `generateMessage()` in `/trips/page.tsx`. Format:

```
Date : DD/MM/YYYY

Order placed by - {requester}

Pick up from - {customer name}
Pick up address - {customer address}
Person in charge - {customer contact_person}
Contact no. - {customer contact_number}

Drop off to - {location name}
Drop off address - {location address}
Person in charge -
Contact no. -

Remarks: {remarks}
Bin drop off - {serial_number}   ← repeated per bin with action=dropoff
Bin pick up - {serial_number}    ← repeated per bin with action=pickup
```

## Coding Standards

### Next.js App Router
- Default to Server Components for data fetching
- Use `"use client"` only when using React state or hooks
- Keep Client Components small and leaf-level

### TypeScript
- Do not use `any` for database returns
- Type all component props explicitly

### Tailwind
- Dark mode is disabled — do not use `dark:` variants
- Always set `bg-white text-gray-900` on `<main>` to prevent system dark mode bleed

### Supabase
- Always handle both `data` and `error` from Supabase calls
- RLS is enabled — always test queries in context of the correct user role

### UI Patterns
- Edit and delete actions always use SVG icon buttons, never text links
  - Edit: pencil icon, `hover:text-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-50`
  - Delete: trash icon, `hover:text-red-600 hover:bg-red-50`
  - Both: `p-1.5 text-gray-400 rounded` base class, `width="14" height="14"`

## Karpathy Behavioral Guardrails

### 1. Think Before Coding
- Highlight ambiguities and ask clarifying questions before writing code
- Never make silent assumptions about intent, architecture, or requirements
- If multiple valid paths exist, present them as trade-offs before starting

### 2. Simplicity First
- Always implement the simplest thing that could work
- Do not add hypothetical abstractions or flexibility that weren't explicitly requested
- Prevent code bloat — avoid speculative future-proofing

### 3. Surgical Changes
- Only modify files or functions directly required for the current task
- Do not perform unrelated refactoring, styling fixes, or housekeeping
- Clean up dead code only if a feature is rewritten or removed

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution
- Break multi-step requests into an explicit written plan first
- Define exact success criteria and verify outcomes step by step
- Do not mark a task complete until the outcome is verified
