# CLAUDE.md — worker-assignment

Admin portal for Yi Hui Tech. See root `../CLAUDE.md` for shared DB schema, architecture, bin validation rules, and Karpathy guardrails.

---

## Project Overview

Two domains:
1. **Projects** — daily worker assignment, timesheets, rolling labour cost tracking
2. **Trips** — truck trip dispatch, bin inventory, WhatsApp message generation, drag-to-reorder

**Repo:** https://github.com/yihui-tech/worker-assignment
**Companion app:** `trips-records` → https://github.com/yihui-tech/trips-records

## Cross-App Interactions with trips-records

Both apps share the same Supabase project. Supabase is the integration point — apps do not call each other directly.

### What this app owns
- Trip creation and all trip metadata (vehicle, driver, customer, site, dropoff, requester, remarks)
- Setting `trip_order` for driver list sequencing
- Adding bins to trips with initial dropoff/pickup actions
- Generating the WhatsApp dispatch message (admin copies and sends manually to driver)
- **Bin location update on trip complete** — currently only `handleMarkComplete` in `/trips/page.tsx` updates `bins` table. Target: move to Supabase RPC `complete_trip()` so both apps trigger the same logic
- Customer, customer_locations, locations, vehicles, drivers master data

### What trips-records does that affects this app
- **Driver marks trip complete** → sets `trips.status = 'completed'` and `completed_at`. Does NOT update bin locations (known gap — fixed by planned RPC)
- **Driver records weigh_bridge loads** → this app shows net weight breakdown per load on the trips list
- **Driver can add/edit/delete bin movements** on a trip (same `trip_bins` table) — admin may see different bins than originally set
- **trips-records `/admin`** is a lightweight admin view of the same trips data — can also create trips, edit, complete, and delete

### Known behavioural gap
If driver marks a trip complete in trips-records, bin locations are NOT updated (only status changes). Bin locations only update when admin marks complete in this app. The planned `complete_trip()` RPC fixes this by making both apps call the same atomic function.

### Data that flows between apps

| Data | Direction | How |
|---|---|---|
| Trip details (vehicle, customer, bins, order) | worker-assignment → trips-records | Written to DB, read by driver app |
| `trip_order` | worker-assignment → trips-records | Driver list sorted by this field |
| WhatsApp message | worker-assignment → driver (manual) | Admin copies text, sends via WhatsApp |
| `weigh_bridge` loads | trips-records → worker-assignment | Driver inserts, admin reads net weight totals |
| Trip `status` / `completed_at` | trips-records → worker-assignment | Driver marks complete, admin sees status change |
| Bin action edits (`trip_bins`) | trips-records → worker-assignment | Driver may adjust actions admin set |

## Pages Summary

### / (Home Dashboard)
- Two-panel layout: Project Costs (2/3) + Bin Locations (1/3)
- Cost panel: current month, active projects, sorted by cost descending. Links to `/cost`
- Bins panel: grouped by At Customer / At Yard / Unknown. Links to `/bins`
  - Sections with more than 10 bins show first 10 with "Show N more / Show less" toggle

### /projects
- CRUD via modal; mandays column shows total assignment mandays per project
- Status: active | completed | on-hold

### /assignments
- Pick a date → see all active workers
- Assign worker to project; toggle **Split** for morning/afternoon split across two projects
- Save handles upsert — re-opening same date reloads existing assignments

### /timesheets
- Regular hours + OT hours per worker per project per date
- Source tracked as `manual`

### /cost
- Toggle This Month / All Time
- Filter by project status
- Rolling labour cost per project from timesheets; total summary card

### /trips
- Create and manage truck dispatch trips
- Fields: vehicle, driver, customer, customer site (filtered by customer), dropoff location, requester, remarks
- Bin movements: add bins with dropoff/pickup actions — see root CLAUDE.md for validation rules
- Drag-to-reorder: open trips only, requires driver + date filter applied; persists via `trip_order`
- Trip actions: Complete, Cancel, Copy (WhatsApp), Edit, Delete
- On complete: updates trip status + bin locations (see root CLAUDE.md)

### /bins
- Full CRUD via modal: serial number, type, size, unit weight, status, remarks, location
- Filter tabs: All / At Customer / At Yard / Unknown
- **Days at Site** — elapsed time since last dropoff, colour-coded: green = today, gray = <7d, orange = 7–13d, red = 14+d
- Location badge: blue = customer site, green = yard, gray = unknown

### /customers
- Customer CRUD
- **Manage Sites** (pin icon) — modal to create/edit/delete `customer_locations` per customer

### /analytics
- Bin swap analytics: dropoff counts per customer site, week/month toggle, bar chart

## UI Patterns

Icons — use `lucide-react`, no inline SVGs:
- Edit: `<Pencil size={14} />`, button `hover:text-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-50`
- Delete: `<Trash2 size={14} />`, button `hover:text-red-600 hover:bg-red-50`
- History: `<Clock size={14} />`, button `hover:text-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-50`
- All icon buttons base class: `p-1.5 text-gray-400 rounded`

Nav section icons: `<FolderKanban>` for Projects, `<Truck>` for Trips

## Coding Standards

**Next.js App Router**
- Default to Server Components for data fetching
- `"use client"` only when using React state or hooks
- Keep Client Components small and leaf-level

**TypeScript**
- No `any` for DB returns — use `as unknown as MyType[]` for Supabase nested selects
- Type all component props explicitly

**Tailwind**
- Dark mode disabled — no `dark:` variants
- Always set `bg-white text-gray-900` on `<main>`

**Supabase**
- Always handle both `data` and `error`
- RLS enabled — test queries in context of the correct user role
